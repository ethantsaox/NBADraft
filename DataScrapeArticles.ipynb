      "Skipping Article 8, as it's empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hawks Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 2: The Hawks are all-in on Trae Young so they need to find some defence around him and some more shooters that he can feed with his crafty playmaking skills.\n",
      " - Article 1: As long as the Hawks remain committed to Trae Young, they need to tailor their roster in a way that emphasizes his strengths and masks his weaknesses.\n",
      " - Article 1: Adding AJ Griffin at last year's draft was a start, but the Hawks need to keep pushing.\n",
      " - Article 1: Those aren't anywhere near where they'd need to be for the Hawks to contend.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Celtics Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: Luke Kornet has been solid, but the Celtics could use another center who can play a different style than he does.\n",
      " - Article 7: The Celtics need more bench scoring when Brogdon isn’t catching fire, and another forward can help.\n",
      " - Article 1: In our reality, where the Celtics hold only the No. 35 pick, they might be thrilled to snag a center who checks two of those boxes.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Jeff Schultz Advertisement Third big man: The Celtics should feel confident in their eight-man playoff rotation, which will likely include Malcolm Brogdon, Derrick White and Grant Williams off the bench.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Jay King Scoring forward: There’s been so much focus on finding another backup for Robert Williams and Horford that many Celtics fans have forgotten the hole in the rotation left by Danilo Gallinari’s injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rockets Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: Tanking isn't a viable strategy, since their 2024 first-rounder belongs to the Houston Rockets (with no protection on it), so they'll likely push forward in any way possible.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Rockets, currently in a rebuilding phase, unfortunately, landed the 4th position in the draft lottery and will not have the opportunity to draft the highly-talented French big man, Victor Wembanyama, who is expected to be picked first overall by San Antonio.\n",
      " - Article 3: Additionally, the Rockets possess the 20th pick in the first round after acquiring it from the Eric Gordon trade with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Rockets seem intent on accelerating their rebuild this summer, but they can't lose focus on what this young nucleus needs to be successful.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Rockets have no reason to believe Kevin Porter Jr. can be their long-term answer at point guard—he didn't even double his turnovers (3.2) with assists (5.7)—and they surely know their 29th-ranked defense is in dire need of fixing.\n",
      " - Article 4: On paper, the Rockets took a big step forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bulls Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: The Bulls desperately need someone who can do the same, though finding one at the draft might be impossible, since they don't currently possess a pick.\n",
      " - Article 2: Pick(s): N/A The Bulls have no picks, but they very much need a point guard who can run the offense to pair with Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nuggets Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: As the trade deadline nears, it’s clear the Nuggets will continue being open to discussions that could potentially swap Hyland for a defensive-minded wing or big who (ideally) can also knock down an open shot on the other end.\n",
      " - Article 1: All-purpose swingman Bruce Brown looms as a major flight risk, since he has outperformed the $6.8 million player option he holds for next season, and the Nuggets may not be able to afford his next deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pacers Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: — Kelly Iko Power forward help: The Pacers are loaded in the backcourt with Tyrese Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard, T.J. McConnell and Buddy Hield.\n",
      " - Article 4: Belmont’s Ben Sheppard gives the Pacers another versatile wing who can light it up from the perimeter in a hurry.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Pacers recently held a workout session for Gradey Dick and were presumed to be seeking out shooting wings.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Pacers have an All-Star point guard in Tyrese Haliburton, an elite paint protector in Myles Turner and a pair of impact wings in rookie Bennedict Mathurin and sharpshooter Buddy Hield.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lakers Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: The Lakers need better spacing than this.\n",
      " - Article 4: With the Lakers acquiring some great surrounding talent at last year’s Trade Deadline, this team suddenly looks like one that could have a better shot at having some consistency for the 2023-24 season.  \n",
      " - Article 7: Law Murray 3-point shooting: The Lakers partially addressed their other big need — more size and athleticism in the frontcourt — with their trade for Rui Hachimura.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Grizzlies Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: The Grizzlies looked like a team that might be a two-way wing away from planning a championship parade.\n",
      " - Article 4: For a team that has done such a strong job of building throughout the draft, the Grizzlies jumped at an opportunity to take a HECK of a swing in this class. \n",
      " - Article 3: The Grizzlies have their work cut out this summer as they navigate the upcoming season without their star point guard, Ja Morant.\n",
      " - Article 3: Furthermore, the Grizzlies are searching for a new starting small forward as they are not expected to re-sign Dillon Brooks, leaving a gap in their starting lineup.\n",
      " - Article 4: There’s no player that could be a better fit for this Grizzlies team moving forward, as Smart will give a gigantic spark to the Grizzlies roster.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Heat Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: Jaquez checks a ton of boxes that the Heat are looking for.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Heat need more layers to their attack, and that could ring triply true if their playoff success without Herro convinces them to shop him around this offseason.\n",
      " - Article 4: That’s just what the Miami Heat did with their selection of UCLA wing Jaime Jaquez Jr. with the 18th overall pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sixers Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: If there is a move to be made, the Sixers could probably use another taller or more rugged perimeter defender, perhaps as insurance for P.J. Tucker.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Mike Vorkunov Wing defender: The Sixers have a balanced roster after their offseason maneuvering.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Sixers need a versatile, athletic wing who contributes at both ends, and they have limited resources to go find one.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Kings Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 3: The Sacramento Kings should consider targeting a sleeper prospect with the No. 24 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft.\n",
      " - Article 3: With his experience and expertise, Murray can provide the Kings with much-needed 3-point shooting and defensive flexibility, bolstering the secondary group of a team that recently made the playoffs after a 17-year drought.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Kings have options, they just need to hit on whichever one they choose.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Kings just learned they (finally) have a winning foundation built around big man Domantas Sabonis, speedster point guard De'Aaron Fox and all-purpose swingman Keegan Murray.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Spurs Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: Despite landing Victor, I thought the Spurs added another awesome piece in G League Ignite wing Sidy Cissoko.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Spurs needed a star, and their lottery jackpot delivered one with a non-zero chance of shining brighter than any before him.\n",
      " - Article 1: Prior to the lottery, the Spurs had a few interesting young players but no centerpiece to build around.\n",
      " - Article 3: With his impressive 8-foot wingspan and ability to impact the game from various court areas, he brings top-tier rim protection to the Spurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Raptors Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: Regardless if the Raptors hope to compete again with this core or opt to reset around 2021-22 Rookie of the Year, Scottie Barnes, they'll need more floor-spacers on the roster.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Rich Hofmann GO DEEPER Inside Pass: What Shams is hearing about the Raptors and trade talks around the league Length on wing: Phoenix has had several issues; most will disappear as the Suns get healthier.\n",
      " - Article 4: While I thought that the Raptors could be looking to target an addition in their backcourt, I quickly got intrigued with the selection of Kansas wing Gradey Dick. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Jazz Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: The Jazz, who own three first-round picks (Nos. 9, 16 and 28), need to land one.\n",
      " - Article 3: If he is still available, the Jazz would likely select him due to his potential as a 3-and-D player and his size on the wing.\n",
      " - Article 3: As the Jazz embarks on their rebuilding journey, they have the flexibility to prioritize talent over specific positional needs, allowing them to select the most skilled players available in the first round.\n",
      " - Article 7: As this season has progressed, the Jazz have identified two spots in which they need a starter for the future: point guard and small forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Wizards Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 1: The Wizards need a young, high-ceiling, foundational talent.\n",
      " - Article 10: Prior to the start of the draft, the Blazers completed a trade with the Wizards to acquire forward Deni Avdija.\n",
      " - Article 1: The Wizards want a clear-cut identity, which presumably means either starting over or chasing the elite talent this roster would need to make any noise in the postseason.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nets Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: — Jared Weiss Physical center who can shoot free throws: Ben Simmons and Nic Claxton are two of the Nets’ best defenders.\n",
      " - Article 2: The Nets also need to add another rebounder alongside Nic Claxton and, if he plays enough, Ben Simmons.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hornets Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: After adding Mark Williams in the 2022 NBA Draft, the Hornets added another fantastic long-term big man talent in Barcelona’s James Nnaji. \n",
      " - Article 2: The Hornets will either go for Alabama forward Brandon Miller or G League Ignite sensation Scoot Henderson with their No 2 pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Magic Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: The truth is they just need to get older.  — Andrew Schlecht Shooting: The Magic have a lot of things going for them this season, but shooting is not one of them.\n",
      " - Article 2: The Orlando Magic have been cooking to the boil nicely in recent years and now have three legitimate pieces in last year's No 1 pick Paolo Banchero, versatile wing Franz Wagner and the born-again Markelle Fultz – another former No 1 pick.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Orlando Magic possess significant influence in the upcoming NBA Draft, allowing them to potentially make a notable impact by maneuvering around.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clippers Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: The Clippers gave some Draft diehards the first big “curveball” of the 2023 NBA draft with the selection of Missouri forward Kobe Brown.\n",
      " - Article 3: Additionally, the Rockets possess the 20th pick in the first round after acquiring it from the Eric Gordon trade with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Bob Kravitz Sure, we can talk about the Clippers needing a point guard or another center.\n",
      " - Article 7: Another center would be ideal, but the buyout market may be the move there with the Clippers possessing an open roster spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pistons Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: The Pistons need to build depth and Sasser has the tools to be a sensational change of pace guard from this class.\n",
      " - Article 4: After hiring Monty Williams this offseason, the Pistons have all the pieces in place to take a big step forward for the 2023-24 season.\n",
      " - Article 3: While the Pistons may consider selecting a forward at the fifth pick or trading down, Whitmore would be an excellent choice if they focus on the best available prospect.\n",
      " - Article 7: Sam Amick Two-way wing or good draft pick: The Pistons are rebuilding, but they also have an eye on next season, when they hope to be more competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mavericks Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: The Mavericks weren’t done there, as they traded back into the first round to target Marquette's versatile forward Olivier-Maxence Prosper.\n",
      " - Article 7: The Mavericks won’t make a game-changing trade that vaults them into contention status this deadline, but they need to decide whether there are sideways moves that can prepare them for such deals in the future.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Mavericks’ priority for the offseason is to improve their defense and rebounding, as they ranked 25th in defensive rating and 30th in total rebounding percentage during the 2022-23 season.\n",
      " - Article 4: Lively will need some time to find his groove, but his length and defensive upside should give the Mavericks something they’ve desperately needed.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Mavericks, if they keep this pick, can benefit from his rim protection and 7-7 wingspan without needing to rely on him for offense, given their existing strong players like Kyrie Irving and Luka Dončić.\n",
      " - Article 7: Perhaps the Mavericks should even consider taking a calculated step back this season better prepare for a bigger swing in the future that can provide Dončić with the teammate(s) to allow the franchise to reach its highest aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thunder Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 3: Additionally, the Thunder is in a position where the positional need is not a priority, allowing them to choose the most talented players.\n",
      " - Article 7: Beyond that, the Thunder are too early in the process to know what else they really need.\n",
      " - Article 4: After acquiring numerous picks in a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder during the NBA Finals, it looked as if Denver was targeting a number of specific players in an intriguing range for the draft.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Thunder have already added some talented playmaking wings in the last draft, so they may be looking to add a guard like Bufkin to lead their secondary unit after Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Warriors Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 3: Lewis is considered one of the top shooting guards in the first round and could bring some much-needed offensive consistency to the Warriors’ secondary unit, playing alongside Jordan Poole and Jonathan Kuminga.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suns Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: The Suns also are going to need to find some potential options that could offer some versatility on a cheap deal.\n",
      " - Article 3: The Phoenix Suns made a bold move to secure their championship aspirations by acquiring Kevin Durant in a major trade.\n",
      " - Article 7: You could make an argument the Suns need another scorer to help Devin Booker, but Mikal Bridges has elevated his scoring output and Damion Lee is capable.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Rich Hofmann GO DEEPER Inside Pass: What Shams is hearing about the Raptors and trade talks around the league Length on wing: Phoenix has had several issues; most will disappear as the Suns get healthier.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bucks Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 3: In addition, with the upcoming free agency of players like Jae Crowder, Wesley Matthews, and Joe Ingles, the Bucks need depth on the wing.\n",
      " - Article 4: If you want to talk about a team taking some swings, then the Milwaukee Bucks are right at the top of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pelicans Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: The Pelicans are in a tough spot as they hope that Zion Williamson can remain healthy moving forward.\n",
      " - Article 4: Instead, the Pelicans decided to stay put and selected UConn sharpshooter Jordan Hawkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Knicks Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 4: The focus for this Knicks team will be looking to upgrade their roster throughout the offseason.\n",
      " - Article 7: — Will Guillory Another shooter: You could combine this into two answers: The Knicks need a little more bench scoring, and they also need another shooter.\n",
      " - Article 9: It’s a need most every team has — lack of quality wings in a league defined by wing play — but one that sticks out glaringly for the Cavs after their playoff loss to the New York Knicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Timberwolves Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 7: For a good portion of the season, I would have said the Timberwolves needed a point guard, or at least a lead playmaker at any position.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cavaliers Mentions:**\n",
      " - Article 9: The Cleveland Cavaliers, with no first round pick, enter the 2023 NBA Draft with clear needs.\n"
